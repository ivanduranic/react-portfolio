This app is quite easy to use and understand. On the Welcome page you can learn a bit about myself. On the right side of the navigation bar you can click the Portfolio tab which will display six of my projects/applications. Also, you can click the Contact tab which will enable you to enter your contact data and a potential message to me. My phone number as well as my email are displayed on the Contact page, as well.
